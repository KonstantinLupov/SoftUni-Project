            Ronaldo made his debut in the Premier League in a 4–0 home victory over Bolton Wanderers on 16 August 2003,
             receiving a standing ovation when he came on as a 60th-minute substitute for Nicky Butt. His performance earned 
            praise from George Best, who hailed it as "undoubtedly the most exciting debut" he had ever seen. Ronaldo scored 
            his first goal for Manchester United with a free kick in a 3–0 win over Portsmouth on 1 November. Three other
             league goals followed in the second half of the campaign, the last of which came against Aston Villa on 
            the final day of the season, a game in which he also received his first red card. Ronaldo ended his first season 
            in English football by scoring the opening goal in United's 3–0 victory over Millwall in the FA Cup final, earning his first trophy.
